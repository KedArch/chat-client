# Chat implementation

## Description

Chat implementation I tried to do some time ago. Might return to finish it sometime.

## Features

- asyncio
- TUI with prompt_toolkit
- completion
- control commands
- scripting possibility
- protocol based on JSON

## Technical limitations

- colors and unicode characters were checked only on Linux with readline

## Todo

- comments
- rethink prompt_toolkit usage
- seperate features/functions into seperate files
- more features
